/**
 * @mainpage IronBee Documentation
 *
 * Welcome to the API documentation for IronBee.
 *
 * If you are a module, rule, or server writer, you are probably interested in
 * the public API.  See the Modules list and the files in include/ironbee.
 *
 * Some general documentation on IronBee and development from the codebase:
 * - @ref README
 * - @ref CHANGES
 * - @ref DEVELOPMENT
 * - @ref CODESTYLE
 *
 * Of particular interest:
 * - Module writers: module.h, module_sym.h
 * - Server writers: server.h, state_notify.h
 * - Lua Rule and Module writers: @ref LuaAPI
 * - Everyone: types.h, mpool.h
 *
 * If you are interested in developing the above in C++, see @ref
 * ironbeepp page.
 *
 * if you are interested in IronAutomata, an automata creation and execution
 * framework that targets IronBee's needs but has minimal dependence on
 * IronBee, see @ref ironautomata.
 *
 * If you are an IronBee developer, you may be interested in the private API.
 * First, make sure you are viewing the internal version of this
 * documentation.  That version includes all internal modules, functions,
 * files, etc.  Run '@c make @c doxygen' in the docs directory and look at
 * @c doxygen_internal/html/index.html
 *
 * This page is defined in include/ironbee/apidoc.h.
