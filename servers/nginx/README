This nginx-ironbee module is definitely pre-production.

It requires a tiny patch to nginx code.  This can be dispensed
with if nginx regexp support and nginx rewriting are disabled in
the configuration.  The reason is that nginx regexps hijack memory
management for pcre causing pcre operations from ironbee to fail:
the patch exposes an API to work around this.

It can't reasonably be integrated with Ironbee's build, because
nginx doesn't support loading modules, so it has to be built in
as a configuration option to nginx.  To do that, go to the nginx
directory and configure using:

$ patch -p0 < /path/to/this/directory/nginx.patch
$ ./configure \
	--add-module=/path/to/this/directory/ \
	--with-cc-opt="-I/path/to/ironbee/include" \
	--with-ld-opt="-L/path/to/ironbee/lib -lhtp -libutil -lironbee"

along with whatever other nginx configure options you require.

The file "config" in this directory declares this module to
nginx's build process.
