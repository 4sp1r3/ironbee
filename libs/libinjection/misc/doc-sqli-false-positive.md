libinjection SQLi False Positives
=================================

Some very benign looking queries are sometimes flagged as SQLi.  This
can be due to the nature of SQL, and how some databases process it.
As an example:

    I 'LIKE' YOU

could be considered SQLi and can be used to scan the contents of a
table (In this case it is the `LIKE` operator with two strings).

Fortunately, most false-positives like this are limited to a few
fingerprints and can be turned off without affecting detection of
other SQLi attacks.
