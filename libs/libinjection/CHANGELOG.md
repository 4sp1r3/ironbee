## security

* Fix Issue30: detection of more small sqli forms with fingerprint "1c".
* Fix Issue32: false positive of '*/*' of type 'oc'  Thanks to @brianrectanus

## API Changes

Should be fully backwards compatible.

* If arg4 in is_sqli is NULL, then  built-in fingerprint data will be
  used.  This makes it easier to use in most cases.
* sqlmap_data.json now includes fingerprint information, so people making ports
  only need to parse one file.
* sqli_fingerprints.h is now deprecated, this functionality is now included
  in sqlparse_data.h.  Now most users will now only need to include sqlparse.h,
  instead of two files.

## other

* Allow clang compiler (also in Jenkins, a build with clang and
  make-scan is done)
* Optimizations should result in > 10% performance for normal workloads

# v1.2.0 2013-05-06

# v1.1.0 2013-05-04

* Fix for nested c-style comments used by postgresql and transact-sql.
  Thanks to @Kanatoko for the report.
* Numerous additions to SQL functions lists (in particular pgsql, transact-sql
  and ms-access functions)
  Thanks to Christoffer Sawicki (GitHub "qerub") for report on cut-n-paste error.
  Thanks to @ryancbarnett for reminder that MS-ACCESS exists ;-)
* Adding of fingerprints to detect HPP attacks.
* Algorihmically added new fingerprints to detect new _future_ sqli attacks.  All of these
  new fingerprints have no been seen 'in the wild' yet.

## other

* Replaced BSD memmem with optimzed version.  This eliminates all 3rd party code.
* Added alpha python module (python setup.py install)
* Added sqlparse_fingerprints.h and sqlparse_data.json to aid porting and embeddeding.
* Added version number in sqlparse.h, based on
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/#normalizedversion

# v1.0.0 2013-04-24
