 *
 * Memory pool routines.
 *
 * @section thread_safety Thread Safety
 *
 * Let A and B be distinct memory pools.  Say that B is a descendant of A if
 * B is a child of A or a child of a descendant of A.
 *
 * The memory pool code is written to be thread safe for different memory
 * pool families.  That is, if A and B are distinct memory pools where
 * neither is descendant of the other, than any memory pool routine of A
 * can coexist with a simultaneous routine on B.
 *
 * Two import thread safe cases are:
 * - A and B can be simultaneously destroyed or released even if they share a
 *   common parent.
 * - A and B can be simultaneously created even if they share a common parent.
 *
 * Furthermore, all allocation routines can be called on A and B as long as
 * A and B are distinct, i.e, even if one is a descendant of the other.
 *
 * Common scenarios that are not thread safe include:
 * - Simultaneously allocations from the same pool.
 * - Any use of a descendant of a pool while that pool is being cleared,
 *   released, or destroyed.
 *
 * @section Performance
 *
 * This implementation is focused on runtime performance.  In particular,
 * allocation should be very fast and clearing and destroying very fast.  This
 * involves both internal data structures and algorithms and in reducing the
 * number of calls to malloc() and free().
 *
 * As a consequence of the focus on runtime performance, space performance is
 * not optimal.  This trade-off can be somewhat tuned by setting the pagesize
 * for a memory pool.  Largely page sizes will mean higher runtime performance
 * and higher memory wastage.  The minimum pagesize is currently 1024.
 *
 * @section Valgrind
 *
 * If mpool.c is compiled with IB_MPOOL_VALGRIND defined then additional code
 * will be added to communicate with valgrind.  This will allow valgrind to
 * properly track mpool usage and report memory errors.  It adds a small
 * performance penalty and ~8 additional bytes per allocation (slightly more,
 * amortized).
