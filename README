INSTALLATION
------------

The installation process should be as simple as:

  $ ./configure
  $ make install

If you want to use a repository version of LibHTP, do the following:

 1. Use svn export to retrieve the sources of the version you wish to use

 2. Run ./update_version, which will update htp.c with the latest Subversion
    revision used

 3. You may wish to also update htp.pc.in with the correct version

 4. Run autoconf -i --force, which will prepare the library for installation

 5. Continue to install as described above


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The best documentation at this time is the code itself and the Doxygen output (which
should be all right). There's also a quick start guide in the doc/ folder, which
should give you enough information to get going.
