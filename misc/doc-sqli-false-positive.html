<p>Some very benign looking queries are sometimes flagged as SQLi.  This
can be due to the nature of SQL, and how some databases process it.
As an example:</p>

<pre><code>I 'LIKE' YOU
</code></pre>

<p>could be considered SQLi and can be used to scan the contents of a
table (In this case it is the <code>LIKE</code> operator with two strings).</p>

<p>Fortunately, most false-positives like this are limited to a few
fingerprints and can be turned off without affecting detection of
other SQLi attacks.</p>
