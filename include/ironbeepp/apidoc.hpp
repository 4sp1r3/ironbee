/**
 * \page ironbeepp IronBee++ --- A C++ API for IronBee
 *
 * IronBee++ is a (currently partial) C++ API for IronBee.  It largely mimics
 * the C API, but with many adaptations to C++ including:
 *
 * - Object oriented: C global functions become object methods where
 *   appropriate.
 * - Exceptions: Exceptions used instead of ib_status_t return codes.  See
 *   @ref errors.
 * - Functionals: Callbacks can be set to function pointers, function classes,
 *   bind results, lambdas, etc.
 * - Type safety: What is void* in the C API is replaced with appropriate
 *   types or metatypes.
 * - Runtime Type Checking: The C/C++ layer does runtime type checking on all
 *   callback data that is cast to/from void*.
 * - Much else: ostream support, appropriate operators, etc.
 *
 * At present, the API is very incomplete and any non-trivial use will require
 * mixing the C++ and C APIs.  See @ref cpp_c below.  It is expected that
 * IronBee++ will grow to cover significant portions of the C API.
 *
 * IronBee++ makes significant use of boost.  In particular, you should be
 * familiar with boost::function and boost::exception.
 *
 * With a few exceptions (notably module_bootstrap.hpp), all IronBee++ API is
 * defined in the IronBee namespace.
 *
 * Most IronBee++ objects (those that directly correspond to IronBee objects)
 * are default constructable, copyable, assignable, totally ordered (<, <=,
 * >, >=), equality comparable (==, !=), and evaluatable as a predicate.
 * For more details, see @ref pointer_semantics.
 *
 * \section quick_start Quick Start
 *
 * IronBee++ is currently oriented at module writers.  Below is the complete
 * code for a simple IronBee++ module.
 *
 * @c my_module.hpp
 * @code
 * #include <ironbeepp/module_delegate.hpp>
 *
 * class MyModule : public IronBee::ModuleDelegate
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyModule(IronBee::Module m);
 *     void context_open(IronBee::Context c) const;
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * @c my_module.cpp
 * @code
 * #include "my_module.hpp"
 * #include <iostream>
 *
 * MyModule::MyModule(IronBee::Module m) :
 *     IronBee::ModuleDelegate(m)
 * {
 *     std::cout << "MyModule Initialized as " << m.name() << std::endl;
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::context_open(IronBee::Context c) const
 * {
 *     std::cout << "context_open for module " << module().name() << std::endl;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @c ibmod_my_module.cpp
 * @code
 * #include "my_module.hpp"
 * #include <ironbeepp/module_bootstrap.hpp>
 *
 * IBPP_BOOTSTRAP_MODULE("MyFirstIronBee++Module", MyModule);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The above code can be compiled into a shared library and then loaded into
 * IronBee with the @c LoadModule directive.  The module outputs a message on
 * initialization and whenever a configuration context is opened.  The module
 * can be expanded to other module hooks simply by defining the appropriate
 * methods (e.g., @c context_close).  See module_bootstrap.hpp for details.
 *
 * \section includes Include Files
 *
 * There are two options regarding include files in IronBee++
 *   -# Include ironbeepp/all.hpp and don't worry about it.
 *   -# Include the files for the features you use.
 *
 * Each include file will include any other include files needed to avoid
 * compilation errors when @e included.  However, include files do not
 * necessarily include files needed for usage and, where possible, avoid
 * doing so.
 *
 * For example, you can include ironbeepp/engine.hpp without including any
 * other files before hand.  However, to use Engine::hooks() you will also
 * need to include ironbeepp/hooks.hpp.
 *
 * The IronBee++ include files minimize additional includes where possible.
 * The advantage of this approach is that you do not pay (in compiler
 * processing) for includes you do not need.  The disadvantage is that you
 * need to remember to include features you use.  If you prefer convenience,
 * simply include all.hpp.
 *
 * \section errors Reporting Errors
 *
 * In the C API, most functions and callbacks report errors via an
 * ib_status_t return code.  In the C++ API, status codes are converted to
 * and from exceptions.  Every ib_status_t value has a corresponding
 * exception class, e.g., IB_EINVAL corresponds to IronBee::einval.  Your
 * callbacks can throw these exceptions and they will be converted into
 * appropriate log messages and ib_status_t returns.  See exception.hpp for
 * details including how to control the log message and log level.
 *
 * \section pointer_semantics Pointer Semantics
 *
 * There is generally a one-to-one relationship between the C API structures
 * and the C++ classes.  E.g., ib_module_t and IronBee::Module.  The C++
 * classes are, semantically, pointers to internal object.  As such, it is
 * better to think of the relationship as being between pointers and classes.
 * E.g., @c ib_module_t* and IronBee::Module.
 *
 * These semantics have a const complication analogous to consts with
 * pointers.  A @c const @c ib_module_t* prevents the pointer-to object from
 * being changed, not the pointer.  However, a @c const Module prevents the
 * Module (a "pointer") from being changed, not the underlying ib_module_t.
 * To accommodate this, all such C++ classes come in Const (ConstModule) and
 * Non-Const (Module) versions.  A non-Const object has all the functionality
 * of the Const object (and more).  A non-Const object can also be used
 * anywhere a Const object can (see remarks below).
 *
 * As an analogy to @c const_cast, each non-Const class defines a static
 * remove_const() method to turn a Const object into a non-Const object.
 *
 * The following table summarizes const semantics with the example of
 * Module:
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 *   <th>Type</th>
 *   <th>Analogous C Type</th>
 *   <th>Underlying Object</th>
 *   <th>"Pointer"</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td>@c Module</td>
 *   <td>ib_module_t *</td>
 *   <td>Mutable</td>
 *   <td>Mutable</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td>@c @c const Module</td>
 *   <td>ib_module_t * @c const</td>
 *   <td>Mutable</td>
 *   <td>Immutable</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td>@c ConstModule</td>
 *   <td>@c const ib_module_t *</td>
 *   <td>Immutable</td>
 *   <td>Mutable</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td>@c const @c ConstModule</td>
 *   <td>@c const ib_module_t * @c const</td>
 *   <td>Immutable</td>
 *   <td>Immutable</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * As the classes simply refer to an internal object, they can be cheaply
 * copied, constructed, and destructed.  It also enables pass-by-copy, greatly
 * simplifying lifetime concerns.
 *
 * It is also possible to construct singular (equivalent to NULL) objects that
 * do not refer to any actual object.  This is useful, e.g., for enabling
 * storage of IronBee++ objects in standard containers.  You can test if an
 * object is singular by evaluating it in a boolean context, e.g.,
 * @code
 * if (module) { ... }
 * @endcode
 * All behavior of singular objects is undefined except for evaluating as
 * bool, copying, comparison, and assignment.  Singular objects are equal
 * to each other and less than all other objects.
 *
 * All pointer like classes support operators <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != as well
 * as evaluation as a boolean for singularity.  This functionality is provided
 * via the CommonSemantics template defined in common_semantics.hpp.
 *
 * @remark Developers: The Const and non-const classes make use of public
 * inheritance, i.e., the non-Const class inherits from the Const class.
 * Thus, e.g., Module @e is-a ConstModule.  However, the Const class defines
 * no virtual functions.  This works because the non-Const class overrides no
 * const behavior and because the slicing that occurs when copying a non-Const
 * to a Const is acceptable: the Const version has no need of the data of the
 * non-Const version.  This pattern allows shared code, no runtime cost, and
 * natural interoperability between Const and non-Const classes.  It is,
 * however, specific to the circumstances and inappropriate in most other
 * circumstances.
 *
 * \section cpp_c C++/C Interoperability
 *
 * The long term goal for IronBee++ is to enable IronBee development without
 * ever using the C API.  However, due to the use of templates (in particular,
 * the need to push user type information to the C++/C boundary), portions of
 * the C API will always be included.
 *
 * At the moment, IronBee++ is limited and you will need to use the C API
 * for some tasks.  To facilitate this, the IronBee classes provide the
 * underlying C pointer.  This is done via the @c ib() method.  E.g.,
 * IronBee::Module::ib() returns the @c ib_module_t* pointing to the
 * underlying ib_module_t.  Symmetrically, an IronBee++ object can be created
 * from an IronBee pointer via a constructor.
