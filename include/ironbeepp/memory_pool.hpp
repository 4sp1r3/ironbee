/**
 * Memory pool; equivalent to ib_mpool_t.
 *
 * Memory Pools can be treated as ConstMemoryPools.  See @ref ironbeepp for
 * details on IronBee++ object semantics.
 *
 * IronBee makes frequent use of memory pools to manage memory and object
 * lifetime.  The engine, each transaction, context, etc. all have associated
 * memory pools that are used to allocate memory for objects whose lifetime
 * is a subset of the memory pool holder.  This class represents such a
 * memory pool and provides low level routines.
 *
 * As per the IronBee++ reference semantics, an object of this class is best
 * viewed as a reference to a MemoryPool, i.e., as equivalent to
 * @c ib_mpool_t* rather than ib_mpool_t.  As such, they can not be directly
 * created.  Similarly, destroying one does not destroy the underlying
 * memory pool.  There are static create() methods available to create new
 * memory pools and a destroy() method to destroy them.
 *
 * There is no requirement that you use MemoryPool to allocate memory for
 * your own C++ objects.  And doing so has risks as the (C) memory pool
 * implementation is not aware of destructors and will not call them on
 * pool destruction.
 *
 * If your goal is to do cleanup tasks when a memory pool is destroyed, use
 * register_cleanup().
 *
 * Unfortunately, the semantics of IronBee memory pools and the stringent
 * requirements on standard allocators makes it impossible to write a
 * conforming standard allocator based on MemoryPool.
 *
 * If you want RAII semantics for creating memory pools, see ScopedMemoryPool.
