 * CLIPP consumer that feeds inputs to an internal IronBee Engine.
 *
 * This consumer constructs an IronBee engine, loads @a config_path as the
 * configuration file, and then feeds inputs to it.  Each input is treated
 * as a single connection.
 *
 * Only connection_opened, connection_closed, connection_data_in, and
 * connection_data_out events are notified.  This means that the configuration
 * will need to load a parser (e.g., modhtp).
 *
 * As IronBee requires that its inputs be mutable, the input data will be
 * copied to a mutable buffer before being passed in.
