Introduction
------------

CLIPP (pronounced clip-pea) is a framework for generating, manipulating, and
consuming IronBee event streams.

Examples
--------

Send a ModSecurity Audit Log, `february.log`, to a local IronBee configured 
with `ironbee.conf``.

    clipp modsec:february.log ironbee:ironbee.conf
    
`modsec` is a generator. It produces event streams. `ironbee` is a consumer. 
It consumes the event streams, sending them to a local IronBee engine.
    
As previous, but also display the event stream to standard out:

    clipp modsec:february.log @view ironbee:ironbee.conf

`@view` is a modifier. It takes event streams as inputs, displays them to 
standard out, and passes them on to the next element in the stage.

Multiple generators are possible:

    clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf
    
The consumer must be unique though. Generators are processed in order, so all 
events from `february.log` will be sent before events in `march.log`.

Modifiers can be attached to either generators or consumers. Below, the 
`@view` modifier is attached only to the first generator and events from 
`march.log` will not be displayed:

    clipp modsec:february.log @view modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf

To see all events we could attach an `@view` modifier to the `march.log` 
generator or we could move the modifier to be attached to the consumer 
instead:

    clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf @view

Spaces between components and modifiers are optional. Removing them, may make 
which components they are attached to clearer.

    clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf@view
    
There are many generators, modifiers, and consumers.  See below for specifics.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration consists of chains.  Each chain is a generator or a consumer
and zero or more modifiers.  The last chain listed in the configuration is
interpreted as the consumer and all others as generators.  There must be at
least two chains: a generator and a consumer.

Generators, consumers, and modifiers are all components.  Components are 
written as `name`:`argument` or, if `argument` is the empty string, just 
`name`. Modifiers are distinguished by beginning with `@`. The component
they modify is referred to as the *base* component. Modifiers may be separated 
from earlier components (base or previous modifier) by white space, but this 
is optional.

Component names only consist of lower case letters and underscores.  Arguments
may contain spaces but, if so, must be in double quotes.  Note that these 
quotes must make it to `clipp`, which usually means they are escaped on the
command line, e.g.,:

    clipp modsec:\"my log.log\" ironbee:ironbee.conf
    
Formally, the configuration grammar is, in pseudo-BNF:

    configuration := generators WS+ consumer
    generators    := generator ( WS+ generator )*
    generator     := chain
    consumer      := chain
    chain         := base modifiers
    modifiers     := ( WS* modifier )*
    modifier      := AT component
    base          := component
    component     := name [ COLON configuration ]
    configuration := quoted | unquoted
    quoted        := +(escaped | non_quote)
    escaped       := BACKSLASH char
    char          := /./
    nonquote      := /[^"]/
    unquoted      := /[^\s]+/
    name          := /[a-z_]+/
    AT            := "@"
    COLON         := ":"
    WS            := " "
    BACKSLASH     := "\"
    
The grammar is likely to change in in the near future.  

All arguments after the flags are joined with whitespace and treated as 
configuration text.  You may also ask `clipp` to load configuration from a 
file via `-c` *path*.  Configuration files may have comments by beginning a 
line with `#`.  All lines in the configuration file are otherwise joined with 
whitespace.  E.g.,

    # input.log
    modsec:input.log
    # and then a single input at the end to 127.0.0.1:80
    raw:a,b
       @set_local_ip:127.0.0.1
       @set_local_port:80
    # all fed to ironbee with IDs displayed
    ironbee:ironbee.conf
       @view:id

Input
-----

An *Input* is the fundamental unit of data in `clipp`.  Generators produce 
them, modifiers modify them, and consumers consumer them.  An Input represents 
a single connection with zero or more transactions.  The Input format is 
oriented around IronBee server plugin events and is designed to adapt to 
future changes such as additional events.

An Input is an ID for human consumption and a Connection.  The ID is optional,
and is mainly used by `@view` and `@view:id`, i.e., displayed to standard out
for human consumption.

A Connection is a list of pre-transaction Events, a list of Transactions, and
a list of post-transaction Events.

A Transaction is a list of Events.

An Event is an event identifier (which IronBee Event it corresponds to), a
pre-delay and a post-delay, both of which are floating point values measured
in seconds.  Some consumers, e.g., `ironbee` will interpreted the pre- and 
post- delay values by delaying for that many seconds before and after the 
event is fired.

The following Events are currently defined:

**connection opened** --- Pre transaction only; contains local and remote IP 
and ports.

**connection closed** --- Post transaction only; contains no data.

The remaining Events may only occur in a Transaction.

**connection data in** --- Contains data.

**connection data out** --- Contains data.

**request started** --- Contains some of raw data, method, uri, and protocol.

**request header** --- Contains zero or more headers, each of which is a name
and value.

**request header finished** --- Contains no data.

**request body** -- Contains data.

**request finished** --- Contains no data.

**response started** --- Contains some of raw data, status, message, and 
protocol.

**response header** --- Contains zero or more headers, each of which is a name
and value.

**response header finished** --- Contains no data.

**response body** -- Contains data.

**response finished** --- Contains no data.

Typically, there are two classes of Inputs:

1. Consists of a connection open event, then a sequence of transactions each
consisting of a connection data in and a connection data out event, and then a
connection closed event.  These inputs are typical of generators that read
other formats including `modsec`, `apache`, `raw`, and `suricata`.  
Unmodified, they are usually consumed by an IronBee that uses modhtp to 
parse them.

2. Consists of a connection open event, then a sequence of transactions each
consisting of request started, request header, request body, request finished, 
response started, response header, response body, response finished, and then
a connection closed event.  These are meant to represent input to IronBee from
a source that already does basic parsing.

Other Inputs beyond the above two are certainly possible.  E.g., connection 
data in might occur several times in a row to test data that comes in batches.


Protobuf File Format
--------------------

The CLIPP protobuf file format and it associated components: `pb` and 
`writepb` are especially important.  The protobuf format completely captures 
the Input is the most powerful and flexible format.

The Protobuf format is compact to begin with and uses gzip compression to 
further reduce its size.  If you have a lot of data that you are going to run
through `clipp` multiple times, consider converting it to protobuf format
first via `writepb`.

Generators
----------

All generators except pcap that take file system paths support using - to
indicate stdin.

**pb**:*path* 

Generate Input from CLIPP Protobuf file.

**raw**:*request*,*response* 

Generate events from a pair of raw files.  Bogus IP and ports are used for the
connection opened event.  You can override those with the `@set_`*X* 
modifiers.

This generator produces a single input with a single transaction.  A 
connection opened and connection closed event are included along with a 
single pair of connection data in and connection data out events in the 
transaction.

**modsec**:*path* --- Generate events from ModSecurity audit log.

ModSecurity audit logs are often somewhat corrupted.  CLIPP will emit a 
message, ignore, and continue processing whenever it fails to parse an entry.

This generator produces an Input for each audit log entry.  The Input consists
of a single transaction with the request and response.

**apache**:*path* --- Generate events from an Apache log.

The log must be in NCSA format:

    "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""
    
Only `Referer` and `User-Agent` headers are included.  No bodies are included.

This generator produces an Input for each line of the log.  The Input consists
of a single transaction with the fabricated request and response.

**suricata**:*path* --- Generate events from a Suricata log.

This generator behaves almost identically to `apache` but reads Suricata log
format instead. 

**htp**:*path: --- Generate events from a libHTP test file.

A libHTP test file is a sequence of request and response blocks.  Request 
blocks begin with `>>>` on a line by itself and response blocks begin with
`<<<` on a line by itself. 

This generator produces a single Input from the file.  The Input consists of
a transaction for every pair of request and response blocks.  The connection
opened event has bogus information.

You may omit response blocks in which case they default to the empty string.  
You may not omit request blocks.

**echo**:*request*: --- Generate a event with request line *request*.

This is mostly intended for debugging.  There is no response body and the
request is a single line.  Connection information is bogus.

**pcap**:*path*<br>
**pcap**:*path*:*filter*

Generates inputs based on reassembled PCAP.

The PCAP is reassembled via libNIDS.  It is somewhat fragile and may get
transaction boundaries wrong if there a connection has traffic flowing
simultaneously in both directions.  It generates connection data events so 
use @parse if you want parsed events.

Note that only complete streams are generated as inputs.  In particular, this
means that you will need both directions of traffic to get any inputs, e.g.,
use symmetric filters such as

    src 1.2.3.4 or dst 1.2.3.4

Modifiers
---------

**@view**

All Events are output to standard out in human readable format.  Unprintable
characters are represented by `[`*X*`]` where *X* is the hex value.

If the string encoders (modp) library is available, URL decoded versions of
the raw request line and URI are also output.

**@view:id**

This modifier is identical to `@view` except only the IDs of each input are 
displayed.

**@view:summary**

This modifier is identical to `@view` except a summary of each input is 
displayed.  The summary is the ID, connection information, and number of
transactions.

**@set_local_ip**:*ip*<br>
**@set_local_port**:*port*<br>
**@set_remote_ip**:*ip*<br>
**@set_remote_port**:*port*<br>

These modifiers change *every* connection opened event to use the given 
parameters.

**@parse**

This modifier converts all connection data in events into request started, 
request headers, request finished events and call connection data out events
into response started, response headers, and response finished events.

The parser used to do this is extremely simple.  It, essentially, splits the
first line on spaces into three values (the request/response line values), 
splits the next lines on : into two values (header key and value), and, when
it sees a blank line, treats the remainder of the data as the body.

At present, @parse does not support repeated connection data in or connection
data out events.  Handling those properly (also repeat parsed events) would 
require a smarter parser and handling those dumbly (join them and process as
a single block of text) was deemed more unexpected than useful.  So, if 
repeated events are present, an error will be displayed and the input 
discarded.

**@unparse**

This modifier is the opposite of parse, converting the parsed events into
connection data in and connection data out events.  It generates a single
connection data in (out) event for each set of request (response) events, even
if some of those events are repeated.

**@aggregate**<br>
**@aggregate**:*n*<br>
**@aggregate**:*distribution*:*parameters*

Aggregates multiple connections together.  The first connection provides the
pre and post transactions events.  Subsequent transactions have their 
transactions appended to the first.  When there are no more inputs or when
the number of transactions is at least *n*, the connection is passed on.  
Note that the final connection may have less than *n* transactions, i.e.,
it will have the remainder.

If given a distribution and distribution parameters, the value of *n* will be
chosen at random for each output input.  Supported distributions are:

- uniform:*min*,*max* --- Uniform distribution from [*min*, *max*].
- binomial:*t*,*p* --- Binomial distribution of *t* trials with *p* chance of
  success.
- geometric:*p* --- Geometric distribution with *p* chance of success.
- poisson:*mean* --- Poisson distribution with mean *mean*.

**@splitdata**:*n*<br>
**@splitdata**:*distribution*:*parameters*

Splits data events up into multiple data events.  The size in bytes is 
dictated by *n* or by the given distribution.  `@splitdata` supports the same 
distributions as @aggregate.

The pre and post delays of the original event are maintained at the beginning
and end of the split up events.  There is no delay between the split up 
events.

**@splitheader**<br>
**@splitheader**:*n*<br>
**@splitheader**:*distribution*:*parameters*

Splits header events up into multiple header events.  The size in header 
lines is dictated by *n* or by the given distribution.  `@splitheader` 
supports the same distributions as @aggregate.

The pre and post delays of the original event are maintained at the beginning
and end of the split up events.  There is no delay between the split up 
events.

**@edit**:*which*

Edit part of each input in an editor.  The environmental variable, `EDITOR`
determines which editor to use or `vi` if it is unset.  The *which* parameter 
can be any of:

- request --- Request line.
- request_header --- Request header (all lines).
- request_body --- Request body.
- response --- Response line.
- response_header --- Response header (all lines).
- response_body --- Response body.
- connection_in ---- Connection data in.
- connection_out ---- Connection data out.

If the editor exits non-zero then the original text is used.

**@limit**:*n*

Stop chain after *n* inputs.  If there are additional later chains, `clipp`
move onto the next one.

`@limit` is written to play well with the other modifiers.  However, it is 
good practice (and behaves most intuitively) if you place it last in the 
chain.

**@select**:*which*

Only allow certain inputs through.  Inputs are indexed starting with 1.
*which* is a comma separated list of either single indices are ranges of
indices specified as `i-j`.

**@set**:*key*:*value*

Set headers with key *key* to value *value*.  By default, changes both 
request and response headers.  If *key* is prefixed with >, then only request
headers will be changed.  If *key* is prefixed with <, then only response
headers will be changed.  If no header is present, no change is made (i.e., 
does not add headers).  If a header appears multiple times, all instances are
changed.

**@fillbody**

Adds any missing body events and replaces the contents of body events with an
appropriate number (based on Content-Length) or @s.  This is useful for input
sources that lack bodies or for sanitizing sensitive bodies.

Any negative or unparsable value of Context-Length is treated as 0.  Any value
over 1e6 bytes is treated as 1e6 bytes.

**@ironbee**:*config*:*behavior*

Run IronBee as a modifier.  By default, this behaves as the consumer except
as a modifier, i.e., there can be later components.  

*behavior* is optional and can be `allow` or `block` with `allow` as the 
default.  If set to `block`, then inputs are blocked (prevented from 
continuing) by default.

In addition to the above, IronBee rules can use the `clipp` action to control
clipp:

- `clipp:allow` -- Override behavior, allowing input to continue on.
- `clipp:block` -- Override behavior, preventing input from continuing.
- `clipp:break` -- Abort current chain, moving on to next chain.

Note: At present, there is no support for a multithreaded IronBee modifier.

Consumers
---------

**ironbee**:*path*

This consumer initializes an IronBee engine, loads *path* as configuration, 
and feeds all events to it.  The pre- and post- delay attributes of Events
are interpreted.

**ironbee_threaded**:*path*:*workers*

This consumer behaves as `ironbee` except that it will spawn multiple worker 
threads to notify IronBee of events.  The *workers* argument specifies how
many worker threads to spawn.

**view**
**view:id**
**view:summary**

These consumer are identical to the modifiers of the same name except that they behave as a consumer, i.e., can appear as the final chain.

**writepb**:*path* 

This consumer writes the Inputs to *path* in the CLIPP protobuf format.  This 
format perfectly captures the Inputs.

**writehtp**:*path*

This consumer writes all connection data in and out events to *path* in the
HTP test format.  This consumer is really only useful when there is a 
single input in unparsed format.

Extending CLIPP
---------------

CLIPP is designed to be extendable via adding additional components: 
generators, modifiers, and consumers.  As a component writer, you will need to
be familiar with `input.hpp`.

All components are C++ functionals.  You will need to write the functional
(probably as a class) and then modify `clipp.cpp` to add the functional to 
the appropriate factory map (`clipp.cpp` has specific documentation for 
doing this).  If your functional can be instantiated with a single 
`std::string` argument, then this addition is easy.  Otherwise, you will also
need to write a factory functional which takes a single `std::string` argument
and returns the component functional.

All components use shared pointers to the Input class for their parameter. 
This type is called an `input_p`.  All components return a bool. 

Generators take an `input_p&` parameter.  The parameter is guaranteed to be
non-singular, i.e., non-NULL.  The generator can either reuse the Input 
pointed to or reset the parameter to a new Input.  The Generator should make
no assumptions about the value of the passed in Input.  It can be reset, via

   input = Input::Input();
   
A generator should return true if and only if it was able to generate an 
Input.  When it returns false, `clipp` will discard the Input and move on to
the next Generator.

Modifiers also take an `input_p&` parameter.  The parameter is guaranteed to
point to an incoming Input.  The modifier can modify that Input or generate a
new Input based on it and change the parameter to point to the new one.  The 
modifier should return true if processing of this Input should continue and 
false otherwise.  Returning false is useful, e.g., for filters.  If false is
returned, `clipp` will stop processing the Input and ask the Generator for the
next input.

When the generator returns false, a singular, i.e., NULL, input will be sent
through the modifier chain.  This allows modifiers to detect end-of-input
conditions and produce additional input if appropriate, e.g., for 
aggregation or reordering.  Modifiers that are not concerned with end-of-input
conditions should immediately return true when passed a singular input.  The
chain will be complete when the generator returns false and a singular input
reaches the consumer.

Consumer take a `const input_p&` parameter.  They are, however, allowed to 
modify the pointed to Input if that helps them.  The Input will be not be
read after the Consumer runs.  Consumers should return true if they were able
to process the input and false otherwise.  If a consumer returns false, 
`clipp` will emit an error message and exit.

All components should indicate error conditions by throwing standard 
exceptions.  Errors during construction will cause `clipp` to exit.  Errors
during Input processing will cause `clipp` to emit an error and move on to the
next input.  Thus, e.g., if a Consumer suffers a fatal error it should both
through an exception and arrange to return false in the future.

The Input classes provide a variety of routines to ease component writing.
For Generators, there are methods to easily add new Transactions and Events.
For Modifiers, there is a `ModifierDelegate` class and `dispatch` methods to 
visit every Event in a non-const fashion.  For Consumers, there is a
`Delegate` class and `dispatch` methods to visit every Event in a 
const-fashion, with, if desired, delays.

As functionals, components must be easily copied.  A standard technique to 
handle this (and to encapsulate implementation) is to have the functional 
classes hold only a shared pointer to a declared but not defined internal
state class.

For simple examples see:

- `raw_generator.[ch]pp`
- `view.[ch]pp`
- `connection_modifiers.[ch]pp`

Appendix 1: Protobuf to/from JSON/Ruby Hash
---------------------------------

CLIPP comes with two scripts to convert between protobuf and a JSON based
format.  These are `pb_to_json.rb` and `json_to_pb.rb`.  Both act as filters,
taking input on stdin and writing output to stdout.

These scripts are simple, fragile, and load all input into memory.  The 
resulting JSON is a direct conversion of the protobuf and not as friendly to
user editing as might be desired: for example, event types are identified by
number.  As such, the scripts are primarily intended to be used for tweaking
inputs produced by other means.

The `json_to_pb.rb` script actually converts the JSON to a Ruby Hash and the 
Ruby Hash to protobuf.  The hash to protobuf conversion is available to Ruby 
scripts in `hash_to_pb.rb`.

Appendix 2: CLIPP Based Unit Tests
----------------------------------

CLIPP comes with a unit test suite and support for writing unit tests that
use clipp.  This testing infrastructure is an extension to Ruby `Test::Unit`.
If you are unfamiliar with Test::Unit, read up on that before continuing.

CLIPP Testing Support comes with three types of extensions.  They can be
accessed by including the `CLIPPTest` mixin.

The main additions are:

- A command `clipp` which invokes clipp and stores the output.
- A set of assertions about the most recent `clipp` invocation.
- A set of helper routines for generating CLIPP inputs.

**The `clipp` command**

The `clipp` command takes a configuration hash.  The only required options are
an input describing option (`:input` or `:input_hash`).  Several others can
manipulate how clipp is run, and all options are provided to the ERB template
for generating the IronBee configuration file.

Currently meaningful options modifying how CLIPP is invoked are:

- `:input` --- A CLIPP chain to use as input, e.g., `htp:my.t`. 
- `:input_hashes` --- An array of specially formatted hash representing a   
   CLIPP Inputs.  You will usually construct the hashes with helper functions 
   rather than directly.  The hash is the same as described in Appendix 1.
- `:template` -- A path to an ERB template to use for the IronBee 
   configuration file.  The result (as a path) can be referenced in 
   `:consumer` via `IRONBEE_CONFIG`.  This defaults to `ironbee.config.erb`
   in the tests directory.
- `:consumer` -- A CLIPP consumer chain.  If omitted, `ironbee:IRONBEE_CONFIG`
  is used.  `IRONBEE_CONFIG` is replaced with a path to the evaluation of the
  ERB file specified via `:template`.
  
One of `:input` and `:input_hashes` is required.  If `:input_hashes` is 
provided, protobuf will be provided to stdin and `:input` will default to `pb:-`.  If you override `:input`, e.g., to add modifiers, be sure to begin
with `pb:-` as the generator.
  
The following options are used by the default IronBee configuration template:

- `:config` --- Text inserted before the default site section.
- `:default_site_config` --- Text inserted in the default site section.
- `:config_trailer` --- Text inserted after the default site section.
- `:log_level` --- The log level to run at.  Defaults to `notice`.

**Assertions**

Currently only two assertions are supported:

- `assert_log_match` *regex* --- Asserts that *regex* appears in the output
  of the most recent CLIPP invocation.
- `assert_log_no_match` *regex* --- Asserts that *regex* does **not** appears 
  in the output of the most recent CLIPP invocation.
  
Additional assertions will be added as needed.

**Input Generation**

Helper routines are provided to generate inputs.  Ultimately, these produce 
hashes to be passed to CLIPP via the `:input_hash` option.

Routines that generate hashes:

- `simple_hash(`*request*, *response*`)` --- Behaves identically to the raw
  generator, i.e., produces a single connection with a single transaction
  with connection data in and connection data out events.

Routines that return text to be used in the hash generating routines.

- `erb(`*erb_text*, *context*`)` --- Evaluates *erb_text* as ERB.  In the ERB,
  *context* is available via the local variable `c`.  The *context* parameter
  defaults to the empty hash.
- `erb_file(`*erb_path*, *context*`)` --- As above, but the ERB text is loaded
  from the file at *erb_path*.
