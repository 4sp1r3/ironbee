Contributing
============

To contribute code to the project, you will need to be using git to format
patches which you can email to the team.

1) Make a local topic branch

  git checkout -b fix-bug-1234

2) Make changes to code and commit locally as many times as needed.

   # Make some changes
   vi libs/qi/engine.c

   # Add the changes to the index
   git add libs/qi/engine.c

   # Add some new files to the index
   git add modules/mymodule.c

   # Check the status of your local repo
   git status

   # Show a diff of your changes
   git diff

   # Commit your changes locally. If fixing a bug, then add the issue
   # number to the commit message like this:
   #  [#1234] Fixed foo by doing bar.
   git commit

3) Use git-format-patch to generate a set of patches and send upstream to be
   approved/applied.  See also "git-send-email" and "git-imap-send" to make
   this easier.

   * The following would produce a patch file for each commit:
   git format-patch -M origin/master

4) Approver will save the email/patches and use "git am < patch" to apply,
   review, test, signoff and commit on your behalf.

   * All commits maintain the original author's name, so you will get
     recognition for your work.
