<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this document a small Aho-Corasick automata will be created, explored, compiled and executed. Along the way, many features of IronAutomata will be demonstrated and discussed. </p>

<p>This document is oriented at users rather than developers. Developers interested in executing IronAutomata automata in their own code should look at <code>eudoxus.h</code>. Developers interested in developing for IronAutomata, e.g., additional optimizers or generators, should look at <code>apidoc.h</code>.</p>

<p>This document does not cover using automata in IronBee. However, the Eudoxus automata files (<code>.e</code>) generated are suitable for loading into IronBee.</p>

<p>In IronAutomata, a description is used to <em>generate</em> an automata. That automata may then be manipulated by one or more <em>optimizers</em> and then <em>compiled</em> into a form optimized for applying the automata to an input. The compiled automata can be then be executed one or more times against an input, generating results. Automata frequently behave as filters and are used to classify the input or extract portions of it.</p>

<p>Automata and their execution are briefly described in step 2 below, however, if you are unfamiliar with automata, it may be beneficial to review them. A review can be found on <a href="[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory]">wikipedia</a> or in a variety of algorithm text books.</p>

<h2 id="step0:environment">Step 0: Environment</h2>

<p>At present, IronAutomata is part of the IronBee tree. You will need to check
out, configure, and build IronBee.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> The rest of the example will take place in the <code>automata</code> subdirectory of a build tree of IronBee. The subdirectory <code>bin</code> will contain all the program you will use.</p>

<p>You will also need GraphViz installed; it will provide the program <code>dot</code>.</p>

<h2 id="step1:aho-corasick">Step 1: Aho-Corasick</h2>

<p>Aho-Corasick (AC) is an algorithm for solving the following problem: Given a set of strings <span class="math">\(D = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n\}\)</span> and a text <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, find all locations in <span class="math">\(T\)</span> where a <span class="math">\(w_i\)</span> is a substring. I.e., the result <span class="math">\(R = \{(i, j) : w_i \in D \text{ appears in } T \text{ at location } j\}\)</span>. The set of strings <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is referred to as the <em>dictionary</em>.</p>

<p>The strength of Aho-Corasick is its ability to handle a large dictionary. Aho-Corasick runs in time proportional to the length of the input and (mostly) independently of the size of the dictionary. In contrast, regular expressions are more expressive but (usually) oriented at single application. E.g., using AC with 10,000 substrings is fine, searching for those 10,000 substrings one at a time is vastly slower, and applying 10,000 regular expressions one at a time is even slower.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<p>AC works in two stages. In the first stage, the dictionary is converted into a specialized automata. In the second stage, the automata is executed against an input to generate the result. The automata from the first stage can be used against any input. While generating the automata takes some time, executing it against an input is fast. The advantage of AC is the fast execution time, the disadvantage is that the automata tends be large.</p>

<p>An animated description of Aho-Corasick can be found <a href="http://blog.ivank.net/aho-corasick-algorithm-in-as3.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>IronAutomata was developed with AC as a major application. As such, the ultimate representation of the automata will be highly compact to accommodate the large AC automata.</p>

<p>This example will use a very simple dictionary: <span class="math">\(D = \{he, she, his, hers\}\)</span>. </p>

<pre><code>&gt; echo -e &quot;he\nshe\nhis\nhers&quot; | bin/ac_generator &gt; example.a
&gt; wc -c example.a
     527 example.a
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ac_generator</code> program constructs an AC automata in a format known as <em>intermediate format</em>. The intermediate format is oriented at generation and manipulation rather than execution.</p>

<h2 id="step2:lookingattheautomata">Step 2: Looking at the Automata</h2>

<p>Any automata in intermediate format can be drawn via GraphViz. In practice, GraphViz can only accommodate small to moderately sized automata</p>

<pre><code>&gt; bin/to_dot example.a | dot -Tpng -Gsize=6 &gt; example1.png
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="file:example_example1.png" alt="Aho-Corasick of he, she, his, hers" id="example1" />
<figcaption>Aho-Corasick of he, she, his, hers</figcaption></figure>



<p>The diamond is the <em>start node</em> of the automata. Solid arrows point to elipses representing other nodes and are labeled by the input. The dashed arrows represent <em>default</em> edges. These edges are taken when no other edge from a node matches the input. Black edges advance to the next input; red edges do not. Dotted black arrows point to outputs which are generated when the node is entered. The outputs in this example are four byte integers in network byte order. Unprintable output bytes are rendered as decimals in angle brackets. For example, when node 7 is entered, the outputs 3 and 2 will be emitted.</p>

<p>As example, the text &#8220;shep&#8221; will start at node 1 and enter nodes 2, 4, and 7 in that order. At node 7, the outputs 3 and 2 will be emitted. As there is no edge for the current input &#8220;p&#8221;, the default edge will be followed to node 6 at which point input is done.</p>

<p>The outputs record the length of the word that generated them. By looking backwards in the input, the generating word can be extracted. So, in the previous example, when outputs 3 and 2 are generated after consuming the input &#8220;she&#8221;, these turn into the words &#8220;she&#8221; and &#8220;he&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id="step3:optimizingtheautomata">Step 3: Optimizing the Automata</h2>

<p>IronAutomata comes with a small but growing set of automata optimizations. Some of these optimize for space and others for speed. The generator, <code>ac_generator</code> automatically applies two optimizations: output deduplication and edge optimization. Here a speed optimization, translate nonadvancing, will be applied:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; bin/optimize --translate-nonadvancing-conservative &lt; example.a &gt; example_opt.a
Translate Nonadvancing [conservative]: 2297
&gt; wc -c example_opt.a
     605 example_opt.a
&gt; bin/to_dot example_opt.a | dot -Tpng -Gsize=6 &gt; example2.png
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="file:example_example2.png" alt="Result of Translate Nonadvancing Conservative" id="example2" />
<figcaption>Result of Translate Nonadvancing Conservative</figcaption></figure>



<p>The result is a more complicated automata. But notice the lack of red edges. That means that every edge advances the input and, thus, only one edge will be traveled for every byte of input. In contrast, the original automata might traverse multiple edges for each byte.</p>

<p>In practice, for AC automata, the translate nonadvancing conservative optimization is often not worthwhile. Although there are fewer edge transitions, determining the next edge can be more difficult and the larger automata size can negatively impact cache behavior as well as consume additional memory. Any optimization should be measured, benchmarked, and evaluated.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>

<p>Additional discussion on translate nonadvancing can be found in an <a href="#appendix:translatenonadvancing">appendix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step4:compilingtheautomata">Step 4: Compiling the Automata</h2>

<p>The intermediate format is good for generators and optimizers and allows them to function without any awareness of the specific execution engine the automata will run on. However, to execute an automata it must be converted to a representation specific to an execution engine. At present, there is a single execution engine in IronAutomata, Eudoxus.</p>

<p>Eudoxus is written in C and oriented at optimizing memory usage and thus supporting large automata. To compile an automata into a Eudoxus automata, use <code>ec</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; bin/ec example.a
bytes            = 107
id_width         = 1
align_to         = 1
high_node_weight = 1
ids_used         = 25
padding          = 0
low_nodes        = 8
low_nodes_bytes  = 38
high_nodes       = 0
high_nodes_bytes = 0
pc_nodes         = 1
pc_nodes_bytes   = 5
bytes @ 1        = 107
bytes @ 2        = 132
bytes @ 4        = 182
bytes @ 8        = 282
&gt; wc -c example.e
     107 example.e
</code></pre>

<p>By default, <code>ec</code> converts <code>X.a</code> to <code>X.e</code>. This behavior can be changed via command line arguments.</p>

<p>Note that <code>ec</code> converted the 527 byte input to a 107 byte output. Those 107 bytes also represents the amount of memory (plus a small additional amount that is independent of the automata) that Eudoxus will use during execution. I.e., the automata will be loaded directly into memory without any decompression or modification.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

<p>The <code>id_width</code> is an important aspect Eudoxus automata<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>. All Eudoxus automata have an id width that is either 1, 2, 4, or 8. Lower id widths can result in significantly smaller automata but impose a maximum size, in bytes, on the automata:</p>

<table>

<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The output of <code>ec</code> gives the current id width (<code>id_width</code>), bytes in that id width (<code>bytes</code>), and how many bytes the automata would be in every other id width (<code>bytes @ X</code>).</p>

<p>Space-time tradeoffs that increase the size sufficiently to necessitate a higher id width may lose their time benefit due to worse caching. Alternatively, reducing an automata to fit within a lower id width can provide time performance benefits.</p>

<p>By default, <code>ec</code> choose the smallest id width that suffices. The id width can be fixed via command line options. Doing so can decrease compilation time: if you are in modify-compile-test cycle it may be worth fixing an id width to decrease compilation time, and then doing a minimal id width compile at the end.</p>

<p>See an <a href="#appendix:tradeoffs">appendix</a> for discussion of space-time tradeoffs.</p>

<p>Eudoxus automata are compiled for the Endianness of the platform <code>ec</code> is run on. They will fail to execute on an architecture of a different Endianness. In the future, converters (manual or automatic) may be provided. At present, you must ensure that you compile automata on the same Endianness you wish to execute them.</p>

<h2 id="step5:executingtheautomata">Step 5: Executing the Automata</h2>

<p>Eudoxus is intended to be embedded in other software. However, a command line executor, <code>ee</code>, is available.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; echo &quot;she saw his world as he saw hers...&quot; | bin/ee -t length example.e
Loaded automata in 0.086263 milliseconds
       3: she
       3: he
      11: his
      23: he
      30: he
      32: hers
Timing: eudoxus=0.009763 milliseconds output=0.172022 milliseconds
</code></pre>

<p>The executor, <code>ee</code>, needs to be told that the output represents a length that should be used to look back in the input for the value: thus, <code>-t length</code>. The resulting output is the location in the input where each output is generated and that output. In AC terms, this is interpreted as the 0-based index of the character just past the end of a substring in the dictionary along with that substring.</p>

<p>The executor, <code>ee</code>, also provides some timing information. For an automata and input this small, any signal in the timing will be lost in the noise, but for larger automata and over repeated runs<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a>, it can be used to evaluate automata, optimizations, and trade offs. Timing is divided into load time (first line), time spent in Eudoxus (<code>eudoxus=X</code>) and time spent in <code>ee</code>&#8217;s output handling (<code>output=X</code>). See an <a href="#appendix:tradeoffs">appendix</a> for an example of such evaluation.</p>

<p>The executor, <code>ee</code>, supports other output types and can count outputs rather than list them. See <code>ee --help</code> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="appendix1:abiggerexample">Appendix 1: A Bigger Example</h2>

<p>If installed, <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> is a list of words. In this example, an AC automata will be generated from it and then run against it. The automata will be far too large to draw with GraphViz and the outputs will be omitted from <code>ee</code> for length reasons.</p>

<p>We can attempt to improve things by applying the space optimization suite. In the current example, this will result in a slightly smaller automata that runs noticably faster. The space suite applies every optimization that will not increase the space.</p>

<h2 id="appendix:translatenonadvancing">Appendix 2: A Translate Nonadvancing Example</h2>

<p>This example uses a contrived automata to demonstrate the translate nonadvancing optimizations.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; echo -e &quot;a\naa\naaa\naaaa\n&quot; | bin/ac_generator &gt; aaaa.a
&gt; bin/to_dot aaaa.a | dot -Tpng -Gsize=6 &gt; aaaa.png

<img src="file:example_aaaa_conservative.png" alt="Result of applying Translate Nonadvancing Conservative" id="aaaa_conservative" />
<figcaption>Result of applying Translate Nonadvancing Conservative</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that node 8 now has two edges (including the default) instead of one and that no edges are non-advancing.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; bin/optimize --translate-nonadvancing-structural &lt; aaaa.a &gt; aaaa_structural.a
Translate Nonadvancing [structural]: 3
&gt; bin/to_dot aaaa_structural.a | dot -Tpng -Gsize=6 &gt; aaaa_structural.png
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="file:example_aaaa_structural.png" alt="Result of applying Translate Nonadvancing Structural" id="aaaa_structural" />
<figcaption>Result of applying Translate Nonadvancing Structural</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that node 8 retains its single (default) edge which is non-advancing, thus, no edges are added to the automata.</p>

<h2 id="appendix:tradeoffs">Appendix 3: Eudoxus Tradeoffs</h2>

<p>By default, <code>ec</code> generates the smallest automata possible. It supports, via command line arguments, options to trade off space against time.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>

<p>Alignment causes <code>ec</code> to align the location of each node of the automata to a certain number of bytes. If this alignment matches the natural memory alignment of the underlying architecture, and the automata itself is loaded into memory at this alignment (usually the case), it may provide faster memory access and thus superior performance.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> The alignment used (<code>align_to</code>) and number of additional bytes added (<code>padding</code>) is given. In the case above, the alignment was 1 resulting in no padding.</p>

<p>Alignment can be specified via <code>-a</code>, e.g., <code>-a 8</code>.</p>

<p><strong>High Node Weight</strong></p>

<p>The compiler will decide between representing a node as a &#8220;high node&#8221; or a &#8220;low node&#8221;<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> by calculating the space cost, in bytes, of both options and using the lower. This calculation can be adjusted via the high node weight which is a multiplier of the high node cost. As such, a value of 1 results in the smallest possible automata, values less than 1 favor high nodes, and values greater than one favor low nodes.</p>

<p>The high node weight can be specified via <code>-h</code>, e.g., <code>-h 0.5</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking</strong></p>

<p>The best way to use these options is to prepare a sample of the type of input you will be running your automata against, and then measure the space and time at various values. For example, an Aho-Corasick automata generated from an English dictionary was run against Pride and Prejudice at various high node weight values. The graph below shows the time (total time for 10 runs) and space usage:</p>

<figure>
<img src="file:example_pp.png" alt="English Dictionary applied to Pride and Prejudice" id="example_pp" />
<figcaption>English Dictionary applied to Pride and Prejudice</figcaption></figure>



<p>This graph suggests a high node weight between 0.35 and 0.65 will yield significant performance benefits at low space costs. E.g., a value of 0.5 will, compared to a high node weight of 1, run 22% faster and use only 4% more bytes.</p>

<h2 id="appendix4:adviceforeudoxusautomata">Appendix 4: Advice for Eudoxus Automata</h2>

<p>Based on limited benchmarks of Aho-Corasick automata from English dictionaries on English text:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply translate nonadvancing structural optimization. It may not help, but it can&#8217;t hurt: <code>bin/optimize --translate-nonadvancing-structural</code>. If not using <code>ac_generator</code>, use <code>--space</code> instead.</li>
<li>Use a high node weight below 1.0.</li>
<li>Do not use alignment. The effects are minimal. If/when Eudoxus gains an aligned subengine, it may be worthwhile.</li>
<li>Create and run benchmarks to determine the effect of any of the above and any other modifications you try. See <a href="#appendix:tradeoffs">the previous appendix</a> for an example.</li>

<p>The C compiler, however, is unaware of this alignment and so must generate machine code to cover the non-aligned case. As such, the benefits are not what they might be. In the future, a distinct Eudoxus subengine with aligned memory loads may be utilized to increase the benefit of alignment. <a href="#fnref:8" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>High nodes are focused on nodes with many outgoing edges. They make extensive use of tables, providing fast lookup but with a high per-node overhead. In contrast, low nodes use vectors of edges. These give slow lookup, especially when there are many edges, but have low per-node overhead. There is also a specialized, &#8220;path compression&#8221; node used to represent sequences of nodes. <a href="#fnref:9" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
