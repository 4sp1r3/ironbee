- Removed the HOOK_* constants. Use the equivalent HTP_* constants instead.

- Added the "htp_" prefix to all hook functions.

- Renamed hooks.h to htp_hooks.h and hooks.c to htp_hooks.c.

- Added the "htp_" prefix to all table structures and functions.

- list_array_replace returns HTP_ERROR (-1) instead of 0 when the index does not exist.

- Removed list iterators. Use this instead:

  bstr *b = NULL;
  for (int i = 0, n = htp_list_size(l); i < n; i++) {
      bstr *b = htp_list_get(l, i);
      bstr_free(&b);
  }

- Removed table iterators. Use this instead:

  bstr *key = NULL;
  bstr *value = NULL;
  for (int i = 0, n = htp_table_size(t); i < n; i++) {
      htp_table_get_index(l, i, &key, (void **)&value);
      // the key is managed by the table and does not need freeing
      bstr_free(&value);
  }

- Removed htp_connp_create_copycfg(), along with the ability of connection parsers to
  have private configurations.
