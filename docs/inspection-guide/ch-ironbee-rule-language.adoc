== Configuration Based Rules

TBD: For now, just skip to Lua DSL - nothing to see here :)

Advantages;;
  * Simplest form of rules
  * Easy to do simple pattern matches
  * Contained in the configuration file

Disadvantages;;
  * Limited syntax
  * Currently uses configuration file order to specify execution order
  * Tedious syntax, with no options to write templates
  * Can be hard to read for complex rules
  * Are executed in sequential file order per-phase
