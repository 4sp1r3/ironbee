LIBINJECTION
==========================

Libinjection is a small C library to detect SQLi attacks in user input with the following goals:

* Open.  Source code is open, tests cases are open.
* Low _false-postives_.   When there are high false positives, people tend to turn off any WAF or protection.
* Excellent detection of SQLi.
* High performance, almost free.
* Easy to test and QA
* Easy to integrate and extend
