     <title>Inspection</title>
    <para>The whole point of IronBee is to allow for inspecting data. This chapter covers the basics
        of doing just that. Inspecting data is performed through rules and modules. Rules are
        encapsulated logic executed at well define points in the transaction lifecycle. Modules, in
        general, extend IronBee functionality and can provide extensive logic, however modules can
        also be used for inspection when you need more control and flexibility.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Data</title>
        <para>IronBee exposes data in two forms. Data can be in defined as a field or as a stream.
            In addition to inspection, fields are the primary means of exposing and exchanging data
            between rules and modules. A full list of the defined data fields are discussed in <xref
                linkend="rule-reference"/>, however IronBee allows for the creation and modification
            of arbitrary fields. New variable fields can be defined, initialized in various ways
            within the IronBee configuration as well as in rules and modules. This section discusses
            defining and initializing rules via the configuration, leaving further discussion for
            the Rules section.</para>
        <para>Variable fields, or just variables for short, are defined and initialized in the the
            configuration through two primary directives. The scope of these variables is defined
            through the context. Variables can be defined in the main (global) scope, within a site
            scope or within a location scope based on where the directives are used in the
            configuration.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Defining and Initializing Scalar Variables with
                <literal>InitVar</literal></title>
            <para>A simple scalar variable is both defined and initialized with the
                    <literal>InitVar</literal>
                directive.<programlisting>InitVar MY_VAR "my value"</programlisting></para>
            <para>In addition to simple scalar variables, you can also use
                    <literal>InitVar</literal> to define scalar variables within a collection. If
                the collection does not previously exist, then it is
                created.<programlisting>InitVar MY_COLLECTION:MY_VAR "my value"</programlisting></para>
            <para>The variable will then be available as a normal field to all rules and modules
                active in the same configuration context (scope). See the full documentation for the
                    <literal>InitVar</literal> directive for more details.</para>

            <title>Defining and Initializing Collections with
                <literal>InitCollection</literal></title>
            <para>Similar to the <literal>InitVar</literal> directive, you can also define and
                initialize collections with the <literal>InitCollection</literal>
                directive.<programlisting>InitCollection MY_COLLECTION</programlisting></para>
            <para>The above will define the <literal>MY_COLLECTION</literal> collection, however, it
                will be empty. To both define and initialize a collection, you can utilize a number
                of additional <literal>InitCollection</literal> features. The most basic form allows
                specifying key/value pairs with the
                collection.<programlisting>InitCollection MY_COLLECTION vars: \
    key1=value1 \
    key2=value2 \
    key3=value3</programlisting></para>
            <para>In addition to initializing the key values within the configuration file, you may
                also initialize the collection via an external JSON formatted file, allowing for
                controlling the data withing the collection outside of
                IronBee.<programlisting>InitCollection MY_COLLECTION json-file:///path/to/persisted/data/mycollection.json</programlisting></para>
            <para>The JSON is formatted as simple name/value
                pairs.<programlisting>{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": "value3"
}</programlisting></para>

            <title>Persisting Data with <literal>InitCollection</literal></title>
            <para>In addition to defining and initializing collections with static data, IronBee
                also allows for persisting collections which have been manipulated in IronBee. This
                is accomplished in a few different ways, depending on your needs. If you need to
                persist a single instance of a collection, then you can just add the persist option
                to the InitCollection
                directive.<programlisting>InitCollection MY_COLLECTION json-file:///path/to/persisted/data/mycollection.json persist</programlisting></para>
            <para>With the addition of the persist option, any data within the collection will be
                written out to the JSON file at the end of the transaction. The next transaction
                will then be initialized with the manipulated data. Often, though, you do not want
                to share the same collection for all transactions. Instead you need to be able to
                save different instances of the collection based on some other field or set of
                fields as a key. To do this, you need to load the persist module to gain some
                additional
                functionality.<programlisting>LoadModule ibmod_persist.so</programlisting></para>
            <para>The persist module allows you to store different instances of a collection based
                on a key. For example, you may want to store an instance of the collection based on
                the IP address or session ID. This is not any more difficult, just a slightly
                different syntax. The key can be specified using any string, which may include field
                expansion, such as the IP address or session
                ID.<programlisting>InitCollection IP_DATA persist-fs:///path/to/persisted/data key=%{REMOTE_ADDR}
InitCollection SESS_DATA persist-fs:///path/to/persisted/data key=%{REQUEST_COOKIES:jsessionid}</programlisting></para>
            <para>Any data contained in these collections will be read from a file based on the key
                and stored in the named collection. At the end of the transaction, the data is
                written out to the same file. Since this data may accumulated, you will probably
                want to specify an expiration time. This is done by using the expire option, which
                takes an expiration time in seconds. If more than the number of seconds elapses
                between the collection being written out and read back in, the data is purged and
                the collection will be
                empty.<programlisting>InitCollection IP_DATA persist-fs:///path/to/persisted/data key=%{REMOTE_ADDR} expire=300</programlisting></para>
            <para>Since the data is only purged when it is attempted to be read back in after
                expiring, the data may still accumulate on the filesystem. It may be required to run
                a periodic cleanup process to purge any expired files. In the future IronBee will
                provide a utility for this, but for now the expiration date is encoded in the
                filename.<programlisting># Format: uuid/expiration-tempname

            <para>Periodic purging could be accomplished with a cron job to check that the current
                apoch based date is greater than that encoded in the
                file.<programlisting>#!/bin/sh

# Iterate through files
for file in `find $PERSIST_FS_BASEDIR -type f -name '*.json.*'`; do
    # Extract the epoch based expiration from the filename
    expires=`echo $file | sed 's%.*/0*\([0-9]*\)-.*%\1%'`

    # Check if the expires was extracted and the current date
    # is greater than the expiration, removing the file.
    if [ -n "$expires" -a "$DSTAMP" -gt "$expires" ]; then
        echo "PURGE: $file expired=`date -j -r $expires`"
        rm $file
    fi

        <title>Rules</title>
        <para>Rules are the primary form of inspection in IronBee. IronBee rule execution is
            decoupled from any rule language. Because of this, IronBee can provide multiple rule
            languages. Each language has a different use case. Currently the following rule

                should consider other options.</para>
            <para>The rule language allows for inspecting fields and performing actions. There are

                <title>Inspecting Fields with the <literal>Rule</literal></title>
                <para>The Rule directive allows inspecting a set of fields and optionally executing
                    an action. For example, you can specify a list of request methods that you wish
                    to
                    block.<programlisting>Rule REQUEST_METHOD @imatch "TRACE TRACK" \
    id:test/methods/1 \
    phase:REQUEST_HEADER \
    "msg:Invalid method: %{REQUEST_METHOD}" \
    event:alert \
    block:phase</programlisting></para>
                <para>The example above inspects the <literal>REQUEST_METHOD</literal> field using
                    the <literal>@imatch</literal> operator. The <literal>@imatch</literal> operator
                    matches case insensitively against a list of values. In this case the match is a
                    success if the <literal>REQUEST_METHOD</literal> completely matches any of the
                    specified methods. If the match is a success, then the event and block actions
                    will be executed, logging an alert with the given message and blocking the
                    request at the end of the phase. There are a few additional modifiers. The id
                    and phase modifiers are required. The id modifier must be a unique string and
                    the phase modifier specifies when the rule will execute. In this case the rule
                    will execute just after the HTTP request headers are available.</para>
                <para>As an alternate to the above, you could instead whitelist what methods you
                    wish to allow with a similar rule. In this case you would just negate the
                    operator and specify a list of methods that are allowed. If the method is not on
                    the list, then the actions will
                    execute.<programlisting>Rule REQUEST_METHOD <emphasis role="bold">!@imatch "GET HEAD POST"</emphasis> \
    id:test/methods/1 \
    phase:REQUEST_HEADER \
    "msg:Invalid method: %{REQUEST_METHOD}" \
    event:alert \
    block:phase</programlisting></para>
                <para>More than one field can be specified. If so, then each value will be run
                    through the operator, triggering actions for each match. In addition, the field
                    values can be transformed, such as trimming off any
                    whitespace.<programlisting>Rule REQUEST_METHOD<emphasis role="bold">.trim()</emphasis> !@imatch "GET HEAD POST" \
    id:test/methods/1 \
    phase:REQUEST_HEADER \
    "msg:Invalid method: %{REQUEST_METHOD}" \
    event:alert \
    block:phase</programlisting></para>
                <para>Transformations can be specified per-field, or to all fields, using, for
                    example, the <literal>t:trim</literal> rule modifier. Multiple transformations
                    can be chained together.</para>

                <title>Inspecting Streams with <literal>StreamInspect</literal></title>
                <para>Potentially large fields, such as the request and response body, pose problems
                    when they need to be inspected as a whole. To alleviate problems with requiring
                    large amounts of memory for inspection, the request and response bodies are only
                    available as streams. The <literal>StreamInspect</literal> directive is used to
                    write stream based data. This directive differs slightly from the Rule directive.<itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para><literal>StreamInspect</literal> rules run as data is received,
                                which is before phase rules execute on the request/response bodies.
                                Any setup with phase based rules should be done in the associated
                                header phase to ensure they are executed before stream based rules.
                                Depending on the size of the data and the server's buffer size, the
                                data may come in chunks. Because of this, a
                                    <literal>StreamInspect</literal> rule may execute multiple times
                                - once per chunk of data received.</para>

                            <para><literal>StreamInspect</literal> rules have a limited set of
                                operators that support streaming inspection. Currently this is
                                limited to the <literal>dfa</literal> operator, but may expand in
                                the future. The <literal>dfa</literal> operator uses the PCRE syntax
                                similar to <literal>rx</literal>, but does not allow backtracking.
                                Additionally, the <literal>dfa</literal> operator can capture ALL
                                matches, instead of just the first as <literal>rx</literal> does.
                                This allows capturing all matching patterns from the stream. Note
                                that the <literal>dfa</literal> operator is fully streaming aware
                                and will match across chunk boundaries.</para>

            <title>Lua Signature Definitions</title>
            <para>Often you may need more functionality in configuring rules than is offered by the
                configuration language. This is possible by using Lua to provide signature
                definitions. Using the <literal>LuaInclude</literal> directive, you can include a
                lua script into the configuration. The Lua script can define rules as an alternate
                signature definition language. Note that Lua is only being used as the configuration
                language. This means that Lua is only executed at configuration time and not
                required to execute the rules. The rules defined in the lua script are identical to
                those added via the Rule directive, but just use an alternative configuration
                language. This really shows off IronBee's separation of the rules from the language
                in which they are
                defined.<programlisting># Load the Lua module to add Lua functionality into IronBee.
LoadModule ibmod_lua.so

# Include rules via a lua script and commit.
LuaInclude rules.lua
LuaCommitRules</programlisting></para>
            <para>Including a lua script at configuration using <literal>LuaInclude</literal> allows
                the full power of Lua to configure the rules. The included Lua script is executed at
                config time, providing a vast amount of power over rule configuration. Within Lua,
                you can use the <literal>Sig(id,rev)</literal> function to define signature rules.
                The <literal>Sig()</literal> function returns a signature object, which allows you
                to then specify attributes, such as fields, an operator, actions, etc. The following
                is a simple rule using the <literal>Rule</literal> directive, which will serve as an
                example to be converted using the Lua
                configuration.<programlisting>Rule ARGS REQUEST_HEADERS \
     @rx "some-attack-regex" \
     id:test/lua/1 rev:1 \
     severity:50 confidence:75 \
     event:alert block:phase \
     "msg:Some message text." </programlisting></para>
            <para>This is converted into Lua's <literal>Sig()</literal> function below. Note that
                this is an extremely verbose version for clarity. Later, this will be shortened to a
                much more manageable form.</para>

            <para>The <literal>Sig()</literal> function returns a signature object as do all the
                attribute functions. This allows us to chain attributes via the colon operator
                resulting in something much more compact and
                "rule-like".<programlisting>Sig("test/lua/1", 1):

            <para>Even this, however, is a bit more verbose than desired. In practice many rules
                will follow the same form and it will quickly become tedious to write signatures in
                such a verbose format. To reduce this verbosity, the power of Lua is utilized, which
                allows customizing how rules are written by defining wrapper functions around the
                default <literal>Sig()</literal>
                function.<programlisting>--[[ ----------------------------------------------------

            <para>As you can see, this can substantially reduce the verbosity of the rules, however,
                it does require writing some wrapper functions. As IronBee matures, it will expose
                some builtin wrappers in a separate library. Separating the wrappers into a library
                would then reduce this into a file that load the library alongside the rules
                themselves.</para>

            <para>Rule execution order is different when specified in Lua. In Lua, no order is
                guaranteed unless specified. Order is specified in a number of ways. The first
                method is via the <literal>before()</literal> or <literal>after()</literal>
                attributes, which control rule execution order. Note that
                    <literal>before()</literal> and <literal>after()</literal> are not rule chaining
                and do not require the previous rule to
                match.<programlisting>Sig("lua/1",1):
  before("lua/2")
Sig("lua/2",1):
Sig("lua/3",1):
  after("lua/2")</programlisting></para>
            <para>While this is powerful, it is tedious to maintain. As most cases where you need
                rule order are in grouping rules to form a sort of recipe, there is a
                    <literal>Recipe(tag)</literal> function defined which does the following:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Adds the supplied recipe tag to all rules within the recipe.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Forces rule execution order within the recipe.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist><programlisting>Recipe("recipe/1") {
  Sig("lua/1",1),
  Sig("lua/2",1),
  Sig("lua/3",1)
}</programlisting></para>
            <para>Each rule in the recipe will contain the recipe tag and therefore the entire
                recipe can be enabled via the <literal>RuleEnable</literal>
                directive.<programlisting>RuleEnable tag:recipe/1</programlisting></para>
            <para>The <literal>Rule</literal> directive supports chaining rules via the
                    <literal>chain</literal> rule modifier. Chaining allows rules to be logically
                ANDed together so that later rules only execute if previous rules match. Chained
                rules are slightly different when specified in Lua. Lua uses the
                    <literal>follows()</literal> attribute to specify a rule ID to follow in
                execution IF that rule matches. This is essentially reversed from the
                    <literal>Rule</literal> directive which specifies the <literal>chain</literal>
                modifier on the previous rule verses specifying the <literal>follows()</literal>
                attribute on the later
                rule.<programlisting># Define a "lua/1" rule
Sig("lua/1",1)

# Define a "lua/2" rule that will run only if "lua/1" matches

            <para>While Lua signature definitions are very powerful, they are still limited to
                signature like operations. To allow for complex logic you can use Lua at rule
                execution time yielding the full power of Lua as an inspection language. This is
                accomplished by using either the <literal>RuleExt</literal> directive within a
                configuration file or <literal>ExtSig()</literal> within a Lua configuration
                file.</para>

            <title>Alternative Rule Execution via Rule Injection Modules</title>
            <para>Modules may define additional rule execution systems via the rule injection mechanism.
							Rule injection works in two stages:<itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								<para>At the end of configuration, every rule injection system is given a chance to
									claim each rule. Rule injection systems usually claim a rule if it contains a
									certain action. Only one rule injection system may claim each rule; it is an
									error for more than one to claim it. If no rule injection system claims a rule,
									it is added to the default rule engine.</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>At each phase during inspection, every rule injection system is given a chance
									to inject one or more rules. The rule injection system may use whatever method it
									desires to choose which rules to inject. Injected rules are then executed as usual.
									</para>
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist></para>
						<para>The rule injection mechanism is designed to allow for specialized rule systems that,
							for a certain class of rules, are more expressive, more performant or both. For example,
							the Fast rule injection systems associates a substring pattern with a rule and uses
							an Aho-Corasick variant to determine which rules to inject. The benefit over the traditional
							rule system is that rules that do not fire have minimal performance cost. However, Fast is
							only suitable for a subset of rules: those that require certain fixed width patterns to appear
							in the input.</para>
						<para>The default rule engine claims all rules not otherwise claimed. It evaluates
							each rule for the appropriate phase and context in order. This approach is slow but also simple
							and predictable.</para>

        <title>Modules</title>
        <para>When full control is required, then an IronBee module may be required. Modules provide
            the ability to hook directly into the IronBee state machine for fine grained control
            over execution, Currently modules can be written in three languages. Each has a
            different use case which is described below.<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Lua is the simplest language to develop modules as it hides many of the
                        details. While Lua allows for rapid development, it does not perform as well
                        as other languages for many tasks. Lua is the recommended language for
                        prototyping and most higher level module needs - where Lua rules are not
                        adequate. Lua modules also have the added benefit of being able to be
                        distributed as rules, since they are not in a binary form.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>C++ allows near full control over IronBee via the C++ wrappers. C++
                        provides much higher level access to IronBee in a fairly strict environment.
                        However, the C++ wrappers do not cover all functionality of IronBee and you
                        may need to fall back to the C API. Because of the added strictness in C++
                        and near equal performance to the native C API, it is the recommended
                        language if Lua will not satisfy performance or functionality
                        requirements.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>C is the lowest level language for writing modules. While C provides full
                        functionality, it does not provide as much protection as C++ or Lua.</para>
